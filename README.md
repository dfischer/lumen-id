# Lumen ID
Generative IDs (Lumen IDs) for each attendee for the DI Conference on Nov 28.

You can play with the test code here:
https://editor.p5js.org/sarweshshah/full/F4SPgdMbY

The program essentially takes registered participant's name as input and dynamically creates a unique image for each one of them.
The code currently pulls its data from a mock csv file.
