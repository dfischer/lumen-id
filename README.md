# Lumen
A visual identity (Lumen IDs) representing each attendee for the DI Conference on Nov 28. A blended technique is based on programming and particularly on an algorithm enables the designer to create a graphic system of rules that will generate numerous results respectively, based on each attendee’s details.

## How is it made?
Lumen is an generative algorithm that converts data collected from the individuals at an DI conference, into unique and personalised takeaways. The data is submitted by the participant through a form, in digital format. The form captures the ‘professional profile’ of the participants.

You can play with the test code here:

The program essentially takes registered participant's name as input and dynamically creates a unique image for each one of them.
The code currently pulls its data from a mock csv file.
