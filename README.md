# Lumen ID
A visual identity (Lumen IDs) for each attendee for the DI Conference on Nov 28. This blended technique is based on programming and particularly on an algorithm enables the designer to create a graphic system of rules that will generate numerous results respectively, based on each attendeeâ€™s details.

You can play with the test code here:

The program essentially takes registered participant's name as input and dynamically creates a unique image for each one of them.
The code currently pulls its data from a mock csv file.
